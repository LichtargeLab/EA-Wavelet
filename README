Title: EA-Wavelet Analysis 

Code Style and Dependencies:
This repository is written and utilizes a combination of python 3 and python 2 due to versioning of dependencies utilized by the analysis method. Two environment files are provided in the repository, des_mat.yml and wavelet.yml. The first must be envoked for production of the design matrix, the second must be activated for the wavelet analysis. This analysis also uses the graphwave algorithm described and produced by Donnat et al (https://github.com/snap-stanford/graphwave). 

USAGE:
There are two main scripts of this method, vcf_to_dataframe.py and EA_wavelet_analysis.py. The first of which converts a formatted and annotated VCF file into a data matrix which is fed into the second script, which performs the analysis. Usage of the two scripts are detailed as follows:
	
	vcf_to_dataframe.py:
		- use des_mat.yml enviornment 
		- 7 positional arguments are required for this script:
			- vcf file location
			- network file location (should be csv format: node1,node2,weight)
			- text file of case IDs (formatted with only IDs)
			- text file of control IDs (formatted with only IDs)
			- text file containing list of genes that appear in the VCF file
			- specify metric of analysis ('EA' or 'PPh2')
			- save path for output files

	EA_wavelet_analysis.py:
		- use wavelet.yml enviornment
		- 5 positional arguments are required for this script:
			- graphwave repository location 
			- dataframe from vcf_to_dataframe.py output files
			- text file of case IDs
			- text file of control IDs
			- network file location (should be csv format: node1,node2,weight)

OUTPUTS:
The two scripts combined produce 3 output files. These files are design_matrix_(EA or PPh2).txt, missing_genes.txt, and PCA_distances.txt. The first two are produced by the vcf_to_dataframe.py script. The design_matrix_PPh2.txt is the dataframe containing pEA or pPPh2 values per gene per sample. The missing_gene.txt file contains a list of genes which were among the genes in the original VCF file but did not appear in the list of nodes from the network, usually negligable (~80 per ~15000 genes), however it is suggested that this file is examined during experimentation. The PCA_distance.txt file is the final output file of the analysis. It displays the analyzed genes with their PCA distance measurements in descending order.
